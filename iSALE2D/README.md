The files in this folder are input files used by iSALE2D (https://isale-code.github.io/) to simulate impact of the 75-kg CMBD impact. 

The content is as follows: 

  - 'asteroid.inp' describes the geometry used in the simulation.

  - 'material.inp' describes the material model parameters used for both the impactor and target. 

  - 'basalt_.tillo' describes the Tillotson equation of state for basalt (target).
  
  - 'tungste.tillo' describes Tillotson equation of state for tungsten (impactor).
